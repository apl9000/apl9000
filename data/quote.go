		Quote:  "Do I contradict myself? Very well then I contradict myself. (I am large, I contain multitudes)",

		Author: "Alfred North Whitehead",
	},
	{
		Quote:  "What's new? is an interesting and broadening eternal question, but one which, if pursued exclusively, results only in an endless parade of trivia and fashion, the silt of tomorrow. I would like, instead, to be concerned with the question 'What is best?', a question which cuts deeply rather than broadly, a question whose answers tend to move the silt downstream.",
		Author: "Robert M. Pirsig",
	},
	{
		Quote:  "Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.",

	{

		Author: "Kelly Ripley Feller",
	},
	{
		Quote:  "The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creation are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures.",
		Author: "Fred Brooks",
	},
	{
		Quote:  "If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch you must first invent the universe.",
		Author: "Carl Sagan",
